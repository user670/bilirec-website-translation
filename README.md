# bilirec-website-translation

**Work in progress - you might want to come back later.**

This repository aims to translate the documentation of BililiveRecorder to English.

This repository is forked at commit dc5cd0baace27dc9acd281dc48d700af99c5326c , up to date to version 1.3.11. It is unlikely that this documentation be updated further to reflect future updates.

This translation will remove custom formatting from the original text, and instead use vanilla GitHub-flavored markdown syntax so that the document can be directly viewed within GitHub.
